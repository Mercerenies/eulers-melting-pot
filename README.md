# Euler's Melting Pot

This is a Project Euler attempt. The catch is that every challenge will be completed in a different programming language.

## Languages Used

Full details of the various solutions are listed below, but for the sake of easy reference, here is an alphabetized
list of the languages that have been used in these challenges so far.
* Batch
* Brainf**k
* Golfscript
* Hexagony
* J
* Jelly
* Whitespace

## Completed Challenges

### Euler 1
* File: problem1.golf
* Language: Golfscript
* Compiler / Interpreter: [copy.sh](https://copy.sh/golfscript/)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 2
* File: problem2.bf
* Language: Brainf**k
* Compiler / Interpreter: [copy.sh](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/)
* Notes: This code was written with the help of a Lisp translator program.

### Euler 3
* File: problem3.ijs
* Language: J
* Compiler / Interpreter: [The de facto standard](http://jsoftware.com/)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 4
* File: problem4.bat
* Language: Batch
* Compiler / Interpreter: Windows CMD
* Notes: This one is really slow. Interestingly, it seems to be not the palindrome check but the multiplication that slows it down.

### Euler 5
* File: problem5.jelly
* Language: Jelly
* Compiler / Interpreter: [tryitonline.net](http://jelly.tryitonline.net/)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 6
* File: problem6.hxg
* Language: Hexagony
* Compiler / Interpreter: [The reference implementation](https://github.com/m-ender/hexagony)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 7
* File: problem7.ws
* Language: Whitespace
* Compiler / Interpreter: [tryitonline.net](http://whitespace.tryitonline.net/)
* Notes: This code was written with the help of a Lisp translator program.

## Final Notes

You'll notice that I'm not using many of the mainstream languages so far. This is not because I'm trying to make this challenge harder
than it is; this is a purely strategic decision. The later Project Euler problems are more difficult, so I am saving the powerful
and easy-to-use languages for them and using obscure, esoteric languages for the easier problems.
