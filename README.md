# Euler's Melting Pot

This is a Project Euler attempt. The catch is that every challenge will be completed in a different programming language.

## Completed Challenges

### Euler 1
* File: problem1.golf
* Language: Golfscript
* Compiler / Interpreter: [copy.sh](https://copy.sh/golfscript/)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 2
* File: problem2.bf
* Language: Brainf**k
* Compiler / Interpreter [copy.sh](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/)
* Notes: This code was written with the help of a Lisp translator program.

### Euler 3
* File: problem3.ijs
* Language: J
* Compiler / Interpreter: [The de facto standard](http://jsoftware.com/)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 4
* File: problem4.bat
* Language: Batch
* Compiler / Interpreter: Windows CMD
* Notes: This one is really slow. Interestingly, it seems to be not the palindrome check but the multiplication that slows it down.

### Euler 5
* File: problem5.jelly
* Language: Jelly
* Compiler / Interpreter: [tryitonline.net](http://jelly.tryitonline.net/)
* Notes: (None)

### Euler 6
* File: problem6.hxg
* Language: Hexagony
* Compiler / Interpreter: [The reference implementation](https://github.com/m-ender/hexagony)
* Notes: (None)
