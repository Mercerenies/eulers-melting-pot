## Valid Languages

Mostly, I am just using common sense to determine what constitutes a "language". In particular,
a language does not have to be Turing-complete in order for me to consider using it for this challenge.
Here are just a few of the guidelines I am following. These are in no way permanent or binding and will
change as I progress.
* ~~All Assembly languages are the same. Assembly will appear exactly once total.~~
* BF-derivatives and BF-clones are considered identical to Brainf**k and will not be used.
* Lisp derivatives are considered distinct~~, but Scheme and its derivatives all fall under the umbrella of
  Scheme~~. That is, there will be a Racket, a Common Lisp, and an ELisp, which are all distinct languages.
* Sufficiently different BASIC dialects will be considered distinct. That is, Visual BASIC, Liberty BASIC, and
  QBASIC are distinct languages, but Liberty BASIC and JustBASIC are one and the same.
* The result should be in a normal, human readable form. For example, in BF it is insufficient to print the
  ASCII character associated with the integer result; it is required to print the result as a number. There is
  no specific required format, as some languages may include some garbage around the answer, so long as the
  answer as outputted is clear and readable.
* I have written a few programming languages. At least one of them is in a usable state right now. For fairness,
  I will not be using any language that I myself wrote.

## Final Notes

You'll notice that I'm not using many of the mainstream languages so far. This is not because I'm trying to
make this challenge harder than it is; this is a purely strategic decision. The later Project Euler problems
are more difficult, so I am saving the powerful and easy-to-use languages for them and using obscure, esoteric
languages for the easier problems.
