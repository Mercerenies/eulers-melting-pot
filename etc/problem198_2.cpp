  // *reduced* denominator y of (a + c) / (b + d) is greater than d,
  // since this mediant is the next term in the Farey sequence (and
  // thus did NOT appear in any smaller Farey sequences, in particular
  // F_d). We know there exists some longeger w with w y = b + d, since
  // y is the reduced denominator. But w d < w y = b + d < 2 d, so w <
  // 2. Hence, w = 1 and the fraction is already in reduced form.

// Claim: As long as we're taking means of adjacent numbers in some
// Farey sequence, then we don't need to reduce the fraction. Put
// another way, the fraction will always have (reduced) denominator
// 2bd.
//
// Lemma: Let a/b and c/d be adjacent numbers in some Farey sequence.
// Then ad-bc = 1.
//
// Proof (Lemma): Theorem 1 in
// https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Academics/Mathematics/2016/Zukin.pdf
//
// Proof (Claim): The mean of a/b and c/d is written as (ad+bc)/2bd.
// Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that this fraction is
// reducible. Then there is a prime q which divides both the numerator
// and the denominator. Rewrite the fraction: (ad-bc+2bc)/2bd. By the
// lemma, this is (1+2bc)/2bd.
//
// From this form, we clearly see that the prime q cannot be 2, since
// the numerator is odd. The prime q must divide either b or d then.
// It cannot divide b, for the numerator is 1 plus a multiple of b
// (hence, in that case, 1 plus a multiple of q). So q divides d.
//
// Now consider the original fraction again: (ad+bc)/2bd. q divides
// the numerator and also divides ad, so q divides bc. q cannot divide
// c since c/d is already in reduced terms (hence c and d are
// coprime), so we conclude c divides b. But we already proved that c
// cannot divide b, hence contradiction. Thus, we need not reduce the
// fraction. Q.E.D
