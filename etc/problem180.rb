# Note on implementation in Oblivion: We'll be storing rationals as
# two-element lists.
#
# Don't trust local variables or arguments when recursing in Oblivion.
# The language makes them mutable due to a faulty implementation of
# trampoline recursion.
#
# Can't insert() into empty array, so we start with an array of one
# element.
#
# `return` doesn't exit the function, which is why our isqrt is nested
# an exciting 35 layers deep.
#
# The parser is super weird in places which is why we have all of the
# "conda" / "condb" / etc. Speaking of weird variable names, can't use
# numbers in variables, so I'm "numbering" things with a, b, c, ...
#
# Lists are NOT immutable, despite what the documentation says. List
# operations may or may not mutate in place.
#
# Oops! Oblivion can only do double precision integers, not 64-bit. So
# I can't use it here. Oh well, I know what I'm getting into next
# time.
