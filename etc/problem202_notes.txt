Think about it in terms of coordinate grid. Let C be (0, 0), and A/B
be (1,0)/(0,1). Then just treat the laser as a line. The "top" bar is
now this funny diamond-shaped thing, and the tricky part is figuring
out how often we cross that.

x + y MUST be even, for us to exit on C. If it's odd then we exit on A or B

(x - 1)
+
(y - 1)
+
(x + y - 1)


2x + 2y - 3 = refl

For refl = 11
2x + 2y = 8
x + y = 4 w/ x and y coprime

ALSO, if x + y is odd
