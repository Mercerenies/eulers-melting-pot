"Problem135" by Mercerenies

The library is a room. A computer is a kind of device. A computer is
fixed in place.

The library computer is a computer in the library.

Instead of switching on the library computer, solve the Project Euler challenge.

To solve the Project Euler challenge:
	let solutions be a list of numbers;
	repeat with the index running from 1 to 1000000:
		add 0 to solutions;
		if the remainder after dividing the index by 1000 is 0:
			say the index;
			say ".";
	say 1.
