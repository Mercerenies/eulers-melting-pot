;; Generator for Minus programs. See http://www.golfscript.com/minus/basic.html

;; Analysis of variables:
;;
;; There are 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet. Of these, the core
;; language uses "c", "p", "o", and "i" for special variables. The
;; standard extensions additionally reserve "j", "q", and "r". That
;; leaves 19 variables free for us to use as we please:
;; abdefghklmnstuvwxyz. Note that vwxyz start with nonzero initial
;; values, so that requires a bit of care to initialize these
;; variables if we want to use them for something other than the
;; default.
;;
;; Default values for predefined vars:
;; z = -1, y = -2, x = -10, w = -32, v = -(max value of p)
;;
;; I'm definitely using z and v for control flow. DO NOT touch these
;; vars. That's 17 variables left.
;;
;; Free-use variables:
;;
;; * a for final accumulated count
;;
;; * k, m, and n for indexing and loops
;;
;; * t for temporary storage during movs
;;
;; * g and h for other temporary storage during the multiplication algorithm
;;
;; * s and f for the current values of an array index
;;
;; * d for deltas in loops
;;
;; * u is the total number of primes we find
;;
;; * b and e for breaker variables to get out of loops early
;;
;; * l for output of multiplication
;;
;; * y and x (which DO have predefined values but we never use them) for negations of s and f
;;
;; Unused with no initial values: [We used em all :)]
