;; Analysis of variables:
;;
;; There are 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet. Of these, the core
;; language uses "c", "p", "o", and "i" for special variables. The
;; standard extensions additionally reserve "j", "q", and "r". That
;; leaves 19 variables free for us to use as we please:
;; abdefghklmnstuvwxyz. Note that vwxyz start with nonzero initial
;; values, so that requires a bit of care to initialize these
;; variables if we want to use them for something other than the
;; default.
;;
;; Default values for predefined vars:
;; z = -1, y = -2, x = -10, w = -32, v = -(max value of p)
